- Using Eneter to communicate with .Net Server Side,   
  Using [Eneter](http://www.eneter.net/) to build the `TCP channal` between `.NET server` and `Android client`  
  Eneter is a fantastic framework for msg communication. *BUT* `Android 7.0` NOT SUPPORT! I can not use it in my  
  Nexues 6 with Android 7.0.1. More develope details on this communication procedure, please go this [Blog](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/340714/android-how-to-communicate-with-net-application-vi). It is GOOD!
- Just sent raw date to server side, `raw plain text`.
